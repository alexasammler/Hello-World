Hello World!
### Description ###
I created the repository, Hello World, as a way to better understand GitHub and how it works for my class BAIS3050.
#### *Why did I start taking BAIS3050?* ####
1. My current major is Business Analytics and Information Systems.
2. It is required for my major.
3. So far, it has been a great help resume and job-seeking-wise.
4. I look forward to hear from the panelists!
